## Model A
Accuracy:
- Draws a rectangular selection area on the screen but doesn't report its size.
+ Makes the screen dimensions invisible when hovered on.
- Doesn't display lines from each edge of the selection area which extend to the edges of the screen and also display the distance between the edges of the screen.
- The measurement lines which should extend from the edges of the measurement area to the screen's edges are not tethered to the center of the various edges of the selection area.
- Only two measurement lines, instead of 4 (one for each side) are displayed.
- The measurement lines do not display the distance between the edges of the screen and the measurement area. It displays some numbers

The app is looking really nice now! But there's one final thing. I want to be able to turn on/off the entire measurement feature at the click of a button and use the web-app normally. After the measurement widget has been disabled, everything relating to it disappears from the screens. The associated event listeners also be removed. Please provide the full JavaScript code. You may skim out on parts of the HTML that have not been changed however, but the full JS is necessary.

## Response A
### Instruction Following:
Does not provide the full JavaScript as requested.

### Accuracy:
The "Toggle Measurement" button can't be clicked on. The widget measuring code prevents the click from reaching the toggle button if it is placed outside of the measuring-widget element. If the toggle button is placed within the widget area (`#measuring-widget`), then after the first click, it becomes inaccessible due to the widget area being hidden.

### Explanation Quality:
The response is very lacking in detail. It fails to explain how the code will be properly integrated into the user's original code:
    - It doesn't specify where the toggle button should be placed (inside or outside `#measuring-widget`).
    - The  `onBoxHandleMouseDownLogic` function is a newly introduced function that was not there in the previous code. There is only a comment saying "Existing box handle logic..." which is very unhelpful. What part of the box-handle logic should be placed in there? What arguments/parameters are needed for the function to run properly?
    
## Response B
### Accuracy:
The toggle button can't be clicked manually. Even after programmatically clicking the toggle button, the disable functionality isn't even fully functional. The measuring "tools" disappear, but the user is unable to interact with the items on the page as they normally would. They are still blocked by an invisible barrier â€“ the `#measuring-widget` element.

### Explanation Quality:
The response doesn't specify where exactly the toggle button should be placed, leaving it up to the user to figure out for themselves. Regardless of where the toggle button is placed, it doesn't even work anyway due to the way clicks are handled in the app.
For the JS code, it is rather straightforward to integrate it.  Conflicting variable/function definitions simply need to be removed after pasting in the code. However, this process would have been made easier if the provided code snippet only included the essential (new) parts of the JS, or better yet, the full code with the changes already integrated.

The app works really fine, but I've noticed that there is still one issue. When you drag from a center handle (top-center, bottom-center, left-center, or right-center) and the cursor moves away from the drag-handle, after releasing the mouse, the dragging doesn't stop. Please fix it.
