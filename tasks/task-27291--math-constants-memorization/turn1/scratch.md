# Prompt
I'm trying to memorize mathematical constants so I can show my friends that I'm a know-it-all. These are the constants I want to memorise:
- π (Pi): Value: 3.14159265358979323846
- e (Euler's Number): Value: 2.71828182845904523536
- γ (Euler-Mascheroni Constant): Value: 0.57721566490153286060
- φ (Golden Ratio): Value: 1.61803398874989484820
- √2 (Square Root of 2): Value: 1.41421356237309504880
- √3 (Square Root of 3): Value: 1.73205080756887729353
- ln(2) (Natural Logarithm of 2): Value: 0.69314718055994530942
- ln(10) (Natural Logarithm of 10): Value: 2.30258509299404568402
- ζ(3) (Apéry's Constant, Riemann zeta function at 3): Value: 1.20205690315959428540
- δ (Feigenbaum Constant delta): Value: 4.66920160910299067185
- α (Feigenbaum Constant alpha): Value: 2.50290787509589282228
- K (Catalan's Constant): Value: 0.91596559417721901505
- G (Gauss' Constant): Value: 0.83462684167407318628
- Ω (Omega Constant): Value: 0.56714329040978387299
- μ (Ramanujan's Constant): Value: 262537412640768743.99
- Apéry's Constant (ζ(3)): Value: 1.20205690315959428540
- Khinchin's Constant: Value: 2.68545200106530644530
- Champernowne Constant (C10): Value: 0.12345678910111213141
- Liouville's Constant: Value: 0.11000100000000000000
- Catalan's Constant: Value: 0.91596559417721901505

These are the features I want in the game:
- A leaderboard that displays the top 10 scores. The data should persist through page reloads or the window closing. Should be accessible through a button on the home screen.
- A reference page where the values of all the mathematical constants used in the game are displayed.
- A clean, modern UI, using any design scheme of your choice (preferably neo-brutalism).

Gameplay mechanics:
- When the user clicks start, a random constant will be chosen and then its values will be read out for the user, starting with the first 3 digits (e.g. "3.13").After each recitation, the user will have to type in the recited values. The number of digits recited goes up incrementally until a total of 20 digits have been recited. After all the digits of a particular constant have been correctly inputted, another random constant is chosen.
- For each correct digit, the user gets one point. When they are able to successfully enter all the values of a constant and move on to another, 50 points are added to their score.

# Turn 1
## Model A
### Instruction Following - 3
Unimplemented requirements:
- Doesn't recite the values of the constants. Instead it displays them, which defeats the purpose of the whole memorization app since users don't need to memorize anything.

### Accuracy - 2
- The program doesn't allow the user to fail, rather it unendingly asks the user to try again.
- After entering all the available digits of a constant, it doesn't move on to another random constant as requested, instead, it cycles back to the beginning of the current constant.
- The reference table only lists two out of the several given constants.
- The digits aren't recited to the user but are displayed on the screen for the entire duration of the current round, meaning that no memory is needed as the user can simply copy the values directly.

### Explanation Quality - 4
The response gives a concise overview of the features to be implemented and then provides the actual code that will make these features come to life. The overview is simple and easy to read and covers the main features of the app. The text after the code also informs the user of caveats they need to handle such as the incomplete list of constants and the leaderboard logic. The only flaw in this aspect is that it falsely states that the digits will be recited to the user when they aren't:
> Randomly select a constant and control the game flow (reciting digits, checking input, scoring).

### Overall Rationale
The application does not provide any failure mechanism; the user has an unlimited number of retries anytime they make a mistake.

## Model B
### Instruction Following - 1
Doesn't give an actual implementation of any of the requested features. Only provides skeleton code.

### Accuracy - 1
- Lazy code implementation: Placeholder comments are used in place of actual code.
- Clicking on the "Start Game", "Leaderboard", or "Reference" buttons doesn't do anything.
- The app doesn't start.

### Explanation Quality - 3
The response gives a concise breakdown of the code and what features it achieves. However, it fails to mention that only a skeleton of the app has been provided and the user will need to implement the necessary logic themselves.
