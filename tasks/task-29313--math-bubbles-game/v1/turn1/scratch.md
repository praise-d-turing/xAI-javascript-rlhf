# Prompt
I want you to create a visually appealing math game that asks simple arithmetic questions: 2 or single-digit multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division. When presenting a division question, ensure that the result is not fractional.

Here are the requirements:
- The user has 3 lives which are displayed as 3 red hearts.
- Questions are presented in the form of a bubble/raindrop.
- Multiple questions are presented at once.
- No more than 5 simultaneous questions should be presented.
- Each bubble has a fixed amount of time before it reaches the bottom of the screen (expires).
- The time taken for a bubble to expire depends on the difficulty selected.
- The difficulty levels should be easy (10 seconds), medium (7 seconds), and hard (4.5 seconds).
- Higher difficulty levels award more points for each correct question.
- When a question is answered correctly (bubble is popped), it should be animated using a laser beam strike.
- The laser gun which pops bubbles is placed at the bottom of the screen.
- The lives and scores are displayed at one of the top corners of the screen.
- The lives and scores should be small enough (with a slight opacity) that it doesn't obstruct the vision of the bubbles, but still large enough to see clearly.
- There should be a leaderboard where the 10 highest scores and their achievers' names are displayed.
- There should also be a home screen where the leaderboard and start game buttons are displayed.

Remember that this is a game, so it should have colorful and vibrant colors, preferably a cool pastel shade.

# Model A
## Instruction Following - 2
- Doesn't animate bubbles falling to the bottom of the screen.
- Doesn't animate bubble popping or laser blasters.
- No laser blaster is displayed on screen.
- The leaderboard can't be viewed, nor is the user's name collected at the end of a game.
- No difficulty selection.
- Division equations with fractional answers are given.

## Accuracy - 2
The model makes an attempt of implementing a basic math bubbles shooter game, but fails to get a large number of the requirements correctly. For example, with division equations, it sometimes sets the larger number as the denominator, meaning that a fractional (and sometimes irrational) answer will be needed, which is difficult – and in the case of irrational answers, impossible – to answer correctly.

## Explanation Quality - 5
The model gives a well-written, response which is well-formatted, free of grammatical errors, concise and straight to the point. It even informs the user of unimplemented features and caveats to the app. The only issues with the produced content lie in the accuraccy or correctness of some of the statements, such as division operations being created to avoid fractional results.

## Code Executability
No Issues

## STDERR
None

## Overall Rationale
The model makes an attempt at implementing the math bubble shooter game, but is missing far too many features and has many inaccuracies.


# Model B
## Instruction Following - 2
- No logic for generating questions.
- Doesn't add a leaderboard feature. Only a non-interactive leaderboard button is displayed on the home screen.
- Poor UI Design. The app hardly looks like a game.

## Accuracy - 1
- The game doesn't start because of an unimplemented `generateQuestion` function.
- Displays "Game Over" even when the user hasn't failed or lost any lives.
- Game doesn't stop even after user loses all their lives.
- The laser beam doesn't point to the bubble.
- No logic for generating questions.
- "Enter" to submit doesn't work.

## Explanation Quality - 5
The model goes straight to the point, providing the code and then listing points of caution to the user. There are no grammatical, formatting, or spelling issues.

## STDERR
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'text')
